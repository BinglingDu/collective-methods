# Bingling's experiments with Beautiful Soup
----
###### Getting title and link of Youtube videos on one channel.

````python
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import urllib.request
import csv

url = 'https://www.youtube.com/user/anflowny/videos'
#The url can be changed into any other channels.
page = urllib.request.urlopen(url)
soup = BeautifulSoup(page.read())
links = soup.find_all('a')
csvFile = csv.writer(open('soup1.csv', 'w'))
csvFile.writerow(['text','href'])

for link in links:
    linkText = link.text
    linkHref = link.get('href')
    csvFile.writerow([linkText,linkHref])

Kept receiving alerts like: TypeError: POST data should be bytes or an iterable of bytes. It cannot be str  
Tried to add duration using .next_siblings and .descendants, but both methods failed.
